🎯 ToneBridge: AI-Powered Communication Bridge for Speech & Hearing Accessibility

🔗 Project Repository: https://github.com/CubingAndCoding/Tone-Bridge

💡 What is ToneBridge?
An innovative AI-powered communication tool that breaks down barriers for people with speech disabilities and hearing impairments. Built with accessibility-first principles using Ionic React, ToneBridge captures not just words, but the emotions behind them.

✨ Key Features:
• Real-time speech-to-text transcription with emotion detection
• Comprehensive text-to-speech with customizable voices
• Mobile-first design for cross-device accessibility
• 6 customizable themes with high contrast options
• Dyslexia-friendly fonts and reduced motion settings
• Touch-optimized interface for all users

🛠️ Built With:
React, TypeScript, Ionic, Python, Flask, Whisper AI, Web Speech APIs

🎯 The Problem:
Communication isn't just about words—it's about understanding emotion. People with speech disabilities struggle to be understood, while hard of hearing individuals miss emotional context. ToneBridge fills this gap by creating a truly bidirectional communication bridge.

💪 The Solution:
By building accessibility into the core architecture rather than as an afterthought, ToneBridge serves everyone regardless of their abilities or preferences. It's not about replacing human connection—it's about making it stronger.

🌟 Impact:
This project demonstrates that technology can be both innovative and inclusive, proving that accessibility isn't a limitation but an opportunity to create better experiences for all users.
